# NUSHI ヌシ

A delightful, classless stylesheet :wavy_dash:

## Installation

Adding this to your project is easy:

    npm install github:onerbs/nushi

## Usage

You can grab the minified file from the `dist` folder:

    <link href="dist/nushi.min.css" />

Or import it on the main file of a React app:

    import '@onerbs/nushi';

## Acknowledgments

This project was mainly inspired by [Basic.css][1], and also by [many other stylesheets][2] with similar goals.
